# TATA Group Data Visualization Project
This project is part of the FORAGE program under the TATA Group, where I learned the basics of Tableau and applied my skills to solve various business questions by preparing insightful visualizations.


## Overview
The goal of this project is to create data visualizations that address specific business questions posed by the CEO and CMO of an online retail store. These visualizations help in understanding revenue trends, identifying high-revenue customers, and exploring regional product demand.

## Questions and Insights

**Question 1**

_**Objective:**_ The CEO of the retail store wants to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011, with a focus on monthly revenue to understand seasonal trends and forecast for the next year.

_**Approach:**_

Created a line chart to display monthly revenue for the year 2011.

Included trend lines to highlight seasonal patterns.


**Question 2**

_**Objective:**_ The CMO wants to see the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue, excluding the United Kingdom. The visual should also show the quantity sold along with the revenue generated.

_**Approach:**_

Developed a bar chart showing the top 10 countries by revenue, excluding the United Kingdom.

Added a secondary axis to display the quantity sold for each country.

**Question 3**

_**Objective:**_ The CMO wants to identify the top 10 customers by revenue, with the highest revenue-generating customers at the top. This helps in targeting these customers to ensure their satisfaction.

_**Approach:**_

Created a descending bar chart of the top 10 customers based on revenue.

Used color coding to differentiate between higher and lower revenue customers.

**Question 4**

_**Objective:**_ The CEO wants to understand the demand for products across all countries (excluding the United Kingdom) to plan expansion strategies. The data should be presented in a single view without the need for scrolling or hovering.

_**Approach:**_

Designed a heatmap to display product demand across different countries.

Used color intensity to indicate the level of demand.
